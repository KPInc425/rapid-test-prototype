# StraightLine aligns **business**, **delivery team**, and **AI** through a simple, strict Markdown-based backlog.
Two sibling files drive the model:
- **Backlog Abilities File `*-abilities.md`** — outcome-focused inventory/features.
- **Backlog Ilities File `*-ilities.md`** — crosscutting, technical requirements and "Definition of Done, Agreed upon Quality, Etc" StraightLine PMM: Ruleset (v2)

StraightLine aligns **business**, **delivery team**, and **AI** through a simple, strict Markdown-based backlog.
Two sibling files drive the model:
- **Backlog Abilities File (`*-abilities.md`)** — outcome-focused inventory/features.
- **Backlog Ilities File (`*-ilities.md`)** — crosscutting, technical requirements and "Definition of Done".

Both files **use the same structure and symbol rules** (see `1-straightline-format-rules.md`).
