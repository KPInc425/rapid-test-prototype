# StraightLine AI Rules

## Core Directives
1. Maintain strict structure at all times.
2. Decompose abilities to 1–3 day scope (including -ilities).
3. Keep abilities outcome-focused; move specifics to Additional Details.
4. Preserve the `ability` keyword.
5. When input isn't structured, transform it into valid StraightLine artifacts.

## Collaboration Protocol
- If an ability touches a crosscutting concern, add or reference the matching -ility.
- When a -ility creates non-trivial work, propose separate abilities to satisfy it.
- If ambiguity is high, ask 2–3 precise questions; otherwise proceed with best-guess details.

## Validation Pass
Before finalizing, check:
- Are all lines either AreaPath, Ability, or Additional Detail?
- Do all abilities start with `ability`?
- Are details indented with exactly one tab and `+`?
- Does each ability reasonably satisfy applicable -ilities?
